# Windows

Setting up doukutsu-rs on your Windows PC is straightforward - just follow those steps.

### 1. Download doukutsu-rs

* Go to the doukutsu-rs downloads page: [**https://get.doukutsu.rs**](https://get.doukutsu.rs)
* Choose the **64-bit** version in most cases. This is the standard version for most modern Windows computers. Click the download link for the 64-bit option to begin downloading.
* If you encounter an error message from Windows saying "This app can't run on your PC" when trying to launch the 64-bit version, your computer likely uses a **32-bit** processor. Return to the download page and download the **32-bit** version instead.

### 2. Create a Folder for doukutsu-rs

* Create a new folder on your computer to store all the doukutsu-rs files. This keeps things organized.
* You can create this folder anywhere convenient, such as your Desktop or Documents folder. Name it something recognizable, like "doukutsu-rs" or "doukutsu-rs folder".

### 3. Place doukutsu-rs in the Folder

* Locate the downloaded doukutsu-rs program file (e.g., `doukutsu-rs.{version}.exe`). This is the file you downloaded in Step 1. The `{version}` part of the program file name indicates the specific build you downloaded.
  * For example, a typical program file name might look like: `doukutsu-rs_windows_0.101.0-beta6.x86_64.exe`.
  * In this example:
    * `windows` indicates it's for Windows.
    * `0.101.0-beta6` is the version number (and potentially release stage like "beta").
    * `x86_64` indicates it's for 64-bit computers (if you downloaded the 32-bit version, it would likely say `x86` or `i686` instead).
* The important thing is to move this entire `.exe` file into the folder you created in the previous step. You can do this by dragging and dropping the file.

### 4. Add Game Data

* You will need to add the Cave Story game data files to the same folder. These files are contained within a folder named "**data**". If you have played Cave Story previously, you should already have this folder.
* **For Freeware Cave Story Users:** If you are using the original freeware version of Cave Story, also place the original game executable, "**Doukutsu.exe**", into the doukutsu-rs folder alongside the "data" folder and the `doukutsu-rs.{version}.exe` file.
* This file in original **freeware** version stores some necessary data files, such as credits sequence sprites, background music and map list - it must be present at least during first run - it can be deleted after first successful launch. This is not applicable to **Cave Story+**, as all required data is present in the **"data"** folder.
* Move your "**data**" folder (and "**Doukutsu.exe**" if applicable) into the "doukutsu-rs folder".

### 5. (Optional) Create a "user" Folder for Self-Contained Settings and Saves

* This step is optional, but recommended if you prefer to keep all doukutsu-rs files together in one folder.
* If you **don't** create a "user" folder, doukutsu-rs will automatically store your settings and save files in a standard Windows location: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/doukutsu-rs`. This location is usually hidden.
* To keep everything self-contained within your doukutsu-rs folder, create a new folder inside it named **exactly** `user` (all lowercase).

#### You can always change this later:

* Even if you skip creating the "user" folder now, you can switch to using a portable "user" folder at any time from within the game. Go to **Options -> Advanced... -> Make portable user directory**.

### Updating doukutsu-rs to a Newer Version

* Updating doukutsu-rs is very easy! When a new version is released, simply download the new `.exe` program file from the [downloads page](https://get.doukutsu.rs) (just like you did in Step 1).
* **Important:** Make sure doukutsu-rs is completely closed before updating.
* Once downloaded, drag the new `.exe` file into your "doukutsu-rs folder".
* You can then delete the old `.exe` file in your folder, or just replace it by dragging the new one in and choosing "Replace" if Windows prompts you.
* **Your settings and save files are safe!** Updating only replaces the program itself. Your game settings and saved games are stored separately (either in the "user" folder if you created it, or in the default Windows location), so they will not be affected by updating the program file.

**Setup Complete!**

You are now ready to play doukutsu-rs. Run the `doukutsu-rs.{version}.exe` program file located in your "doukutsu-rs folder" to start the game. Enjoy!
